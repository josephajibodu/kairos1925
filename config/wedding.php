While scrambling for a space in the bus among many other students, I sighted her from behind. Something struck within me; I didn\'t know what it was, but I knew I wanted to know her. I pushed harder to get on the bus, even leaving my friend behind because I had seen "the lady." By the time I entered, all the seats were gone, and I had to stand. Unexpectedly, Esther and her friends adjusted and offered me a seat beside her.',
