                                    <p>I met Esther on July 10, 2019, during the SEA001 field trip. While scrambling for a seat
                                        on the bus, I saw her from behind, and something just struck me. I didn't know what it
                                        was, but I knew I wanted to know her. I even left my friend behind just to get in, only
                                        to find all the seats were already taken.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Esther:</strong></p>
                                    <p>That's when I noticed him. He looked stranded, so I shifted over, squeezed into my
                                        friend's seat, and made space for him beside me. Little did I know that small act of
                                        kindness would lead to‚Ä¶ this üëÄüíç.</p>

                                    <p>We became friends after that trip, and a few months later, Joseph finally asked me out
                                        (apparently that was the plan all along üòÇ). From field trip strangers to soulmates and
                                        now we are here, counting down to forever.</p>
